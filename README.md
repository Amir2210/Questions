📚 React FAQ Component

This React component renders a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section, allowing users to expand and collapse individual questions to view their answers.

📦 Tech Stack:
* React
* React Icons (for plus and minus icons)
👩🏽‍🍳 Features:

* Displays questions along with an expand/collapse button.
* Allows users to toggle the visibility of each question's answer.
* Utilizes React state to manage the visibility of individual answers.

💭 Process:
The development process began with defining the structure of the FAQ component and its individual question items. I utilized React's useState hook to manage the visibility state of each question's answer. Implementing the toggle functionality for expanding and collapsing questions involved toggling the visibility state upon button clicks. The project provided valuable experience in managing component state and handling user interactions in React.

📚 Learnings:
* Reinforced understanding of React functional components and hooks.
* Practiced state management with useState for controlling component visibility.
* Improved skills in handling user interactions and event handling in React applications.

✨ Improvement:
* Enhance styling for improved visual appeal and readability.
* Add animations for smoother transitions when expanding and collapsing questions.
* Implement keyboard accessibility features for users who navigate using keyboard controls.
